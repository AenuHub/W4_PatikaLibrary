In this exercise, aiming to create a `Book` class in C# representing a book titled "Adı Aylin" by Ayşe Kulin, published by Remzi Kitabevi. The book will have 398 pages. The class will include two constructors to demonstrate different ways to instantiate objects.

- **Author First Name**: The name of the author.
- **Author Last Name**: The name of the author.
- **Page Count**: The total number of pages in the book.
- **Publisher**: The publisher of the book.
- **Saved Date**: The date when the book record was saved.

## Constructor Details:
1. **Default Constructor**:
   - A parameterless constructor that initializes the book with default values and current time.

2. **Parameterized Constructor**:
   - A constructor that takes the book name, author name, page count, and publisher as parameters, assigning these values and current time during object creation.
